# PHP Object Injection

The unserialize() vulnerability, summarizedPermalink
When an attacker controls a serialized object that is passed into unserialize(), she can control the properties of the created object. This will then allow her the opportunity to hijack the flow of the application, by controlling the values passed into magic methods like __wakeup().

The attacker can then execute the code contained in the magic methods using the parameters specified by her, or use the magic methods as a means of starting a POP chain.

POP stands for Property Oriented Programming, and the name comes from the fact that the attacker can control all of the properties of the deserialized object. Similar to ROP attacks (Return Oriented Programming), POP chains work by chaining code “gadgets” together to achieve the attacker’s ultimate goal. These “gadgets” are code snippets borrowed from the codebase that the attacker uses to further her goal.
